	Embedded Computing Platform: Meeting minutes from 09/17/08
mailed-by:

Hey guys,

Lets decide to send out weekly meeting minutes from now on.  I think it should basically be a summary of what we want to do for next week.  I will do so for this week:

To-do for next week's (09/24/08) meeting:
1.  Ilia:  A simple presentation on ANT, talk to BWRC guys about the A/D and D/A they use and he will **try** to get a ROACH board.
2.  Bart:  ROACH board schematics (?????), start doing a block diagram of the new embedded computing platform.
3.  All of us:  need to come up with a catchy name for the board.

Ferenc:  I wanted to practice some GERBER stuff, I just found out that our MultiSim key does NOT work with UltiBoard.  We should get a new key for UltiBoard from Electronics Workbench this Friday.

On an aside, here is a really good and short article (courtesy of IBM) about RT-LINUX architecture:

Have a great week.
